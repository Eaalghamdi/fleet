IVMS Design Tokens & Style Guide

This guide summarizes the Clean Enterprise UI methodology used in the Canvas interface, balancing high functionality with modern aesthetics tailored for the "Asas Labs" brand identity.

1. Color Palette

The colors are chosen to reflect professional trust, authority, and safety:

Primary: #006C35 (Deep Green) - Represents the official corporate identity.

Secondary: #1E293B (Slate-900) - Used for high-contrast dark backgrounds like the Sidebar.

Accent: #00A859 (Emerald) - For buttons, active states, and interactive elements.

Background: #F8FAFC (Slate-50) - A very light background to reduce eye strain during long usage.

Status Indicators:

Danger: #EF4444 (Rose-500)

Warning: #F59E0B (Amber-500)

Success: #10B981 (Emerald-500)

2. Typography

Primary Font: Sans-serif (optimized for Left-to-Right orientation).

Weights:

font-black (900): Reserved for large, impactful main headings.

font-bold (700): For subheaders and navigation menu items.

font-medium (500): For body text and data labels.

3. Structural Tokens

Border Radius:

Cards: rounded-2xl (1rem / 16px) for a soft, modern look.

Buttons/Inputs: rounded-xl (0.75rem / 12px) for distinct interactivity.

Shadows:

Standard: shadow-sm for cards to provide subtle elevation without visual noise.

Interactive: shadow-xl with color transparency (Colored Shadows) for active buttons.

Borders:

border-slate-200 for light external edges.

border-white/5 for subtle dividers within dark surfaces.

4. Interaction States

Glassmorphism: Use backdrop-blur-md with bg-white/80 for the top header to provide a sense of depth and modernity.

Hover Effects: Utilize transition-all paired with border or background shifts (e.g., hover:border-emerald-200) to guide user focus.

Animations: Leverage the Tailwind CSS Animate library for smooth component entry (animate-in fade-in).

5. Iconography

Library: Lucide React.

Sizing: Uniform 20px or 22px for primary nav and action icons.

Visual Style: Use muted background colors for icons (e.g., an Emerald icon on an emerald-50 background) to highlight them comfortably without overpowering the text.

These elements combine the technical robustness required for Fleet Management Systems (IVMS) with the seamless User Experience typical of modern SaaS applications.
